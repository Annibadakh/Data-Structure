# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This repository contains my self-implemented Java code for various fundamental data structures and algorithms. The implementations are designed to be easy to understand and use, making them ideal for educational purposes and as a reference for common coding problems.

## Contents

1. **Linear Search**  
   A simple search algorithm that checks each element in the list until the desired element is found or the list ends.

2. **Binary Search**  
   An efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by dividing the search interval in half repeatedly.

3. **Priority Queue**  
   A specialized queue where each element is associated with a priority, and the element with the highest priority is served first.

4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
   A graph traversal algorithm that explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

5. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
   A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

6. **Graph**  
   Implementation of graph data structure and associated operations, including both adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations.

7. **Hash Table**  
   A data structure that provides efficient key-value mapping using a hash function to compute the index in an array where an element is stored.

8. **Heap Sort**  
   A comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure.

9. **Kruskal's Algorithm**  
   An algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph by adding increasing cost arcs while ensuring no cycles are formed.

10. **Prim's Algorithm**  
    Another algorithm for finding the MST of a graph by building the tree one vertex at a time, starting from an arbitrary vertex.

11. **Stack**  
    A Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end.

12. **Queue**  
    A First In First Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

**Command to run**
  Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own Java class with sample usage provided in the main method. To run the code, compile and execute the Java files using the following commands:
    javac FileName.java
    java FileName
